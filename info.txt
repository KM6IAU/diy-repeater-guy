These are the audio files extracted from:
    http://www.scomcontrollers.com/downloads/SpLibEng_1.3.bin

There are two folders:

    "c": companded (compressed and expanded) audio, bytewise exactly as it is
         stored in the source file.   These will sound like they are clipping
         without de-emphasis applied.

    "d": the aforementioned files, except that they have been de-companded
         using inverse function provided at
         https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-law_algorithm .
         These are the ones that will sound "right", in most cases.

Use the  companded or de-companded audio files depending on if your output is
considered to be pre-emphasized or not.

If you're transmitting from your  personal radio,  you want the  de-companded
audio.  Your radio will emphasize, the repeater will hear your pre-emphasized
audio and re-transmit it  "as-is"  on a different freq.  The listener's radio
will de-emphasize.

If you are the repeater,  remember that the listener will de-emphasize, so if
you're playing a local file,  it needs to be emphasized.   Use the  companded
audio for this.
